# Unlocking Research Potential: A Guide to Using the Conscience Agent

### Introduction: Your New Research Partner

Welcome, researcher. The Conscience Agent is more than a simple script; it's designed to be your tireless, safe, and completely transparent research assistant.

This guide is about a **workflow**â€”a way of thinking and working with the agent to go from a broad question to a focused, well-supported conclusion. Think of yourself as the lead researcher; your role is to provide the strategy, while the agent handles the legwork of searching, collecting, and organizing information.

### The Core Workflow: A Cycle of Inquiry

Effective research with the agent is an iterative process using the desktop application:

1.  **Task (You):** You begin by giving the agent a high-level research goal in the **Task Input Field**.
2.  **Act (Agent):** You click **"Run Task"**. The agent breaks down your goal into actions and executes them. You can monitor this process in the **Log Viewer**.
3.  **Review (You):** You examine the results. Check the **Log Viewer** for summaries and insights, and use the **File Explorer** to open any documents the agent has created.
4.  **Refine (You):** Based on what you've reviewed, you give the agent a new, more focused task. This cycle repeats, drilling deeper into the topic.

### Phase 1: The Exploration Phase - Casting a Wide Net

Start with a general, open-ended task to map the landscape of your topic.

**Example Task:**
> Explore the current state of vertical farming technology and its main challenges.

**Your Goal:** Review the output in the Log Viewer and any files created in the File Explorer. Look for recurring keywords, names, and specific technologies. These will inform your next steps.

### Phase 2: The Deep Dive - Focusing Your Inquiry

Use the findings from Phase 1 to ask more specific questions.

**Example Follow-up Tasks:**
> Find recent studies comparing the energy consumption of hydroponic vs. aeroponic vertical farms.

Over several cycles, the project directory becomes your centralized research hub, easily viewable in the File Explorer.

### Phase 3: Synthesis and Organization

This phase is about bringing it all together. Task the agent to consolidate its findings into a single report.

**Example Synthesis Task:**
> Review all text files in the scratch directory about vertical farming and write a consolidated summary named 'vertical_farming_report.md'.

This becomes the first draft of your final deliverable, which you can then open and refine.

### Best Practices

*   **Start Broad, Then Narrow:** Follow the three-phase approach.
*   **Use the UI to Your Advantage:** Keep an eye on the File Explorer to see what the agent is producing.
*   **Let the Agent Handle the Toil:** Your job is strategy. The agent's job is execution.
