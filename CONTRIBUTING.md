# Contributing to the Conscience Agent

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project is an exploration of ideas, and new perspectives are always welcome.

### Where to Start?

-   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an "Issue" on our GitHub page. Include as much detail as possible: what you expected to happen, what actually happened, your OS, and steps to reproduce the issue.
-   **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new tool, a better rule for the constitution, or a core logic improvement? Open an "Issue" with the label "enhancement" to start a discussion.

### The Pull Request Process

1.  **Fork the repository:** Create your own copy of the project on your GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new branch:** Make a new branch in your fork for your changes. Please give it a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-summarization-tool` or `fix/governor-cache-bug`).
3.  **Make your changes:** Write your code and any accompanying documentation.
4.  **Test your changes:** Ensure the agent still runs correctly and that your changes have the intended effect.
5.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the original repository. Please provide a clear description of the problem and your solution.

We will review your PR as soon as possible. Thank you for your contribution!
