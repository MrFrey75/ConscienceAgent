# File Explorer Component

**Issue Number**: #017  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 4 - Modern Desktop Interface  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  

## Summary

Implement a file explorer to view and manage files in the output directory.

## Description

Create a built-in file explorer component that allows users to navigate the file system, view files and directories, and monitor agent output files. This provides direct access to the agent's work products.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Tree view file explorer with hierarchical display
- [x] Root directory set to current working directory
- [x] Navigation through directory structure
- [x] File and folder icons for visual organization
- [x] Integration with main window tab system
- [x] Standard file explorer functionality
- [x] Real-time updates when files are created/modified

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- `QTreeView` with `QFileSystemModel` for native file system integration
- Professional tree-based navigation interface
- Root path set to current project directory
- Standard file system icons and organization
- Integrated into left pane tab system
- Real-time file system monitoring and updates

## Technical Implementation

### File Explorer Components
```python
# File Explorer Tab
file_explorer_tab = QWidget()
left_pane.addTab(file_explorer_tab, "File Explorer")

file_layout = QVBoxLayout(file_explorer_tab)
self.file_model = QFileSystemModel()
self.file_model.setRootPath(QDir.currentPath())
self.file_tree = QTreeView()
self.file_tree.setModel(self.file_model)
file_layout.addWidget(self.file_tree)
```

### Key Features
- **Hierarchical Display**: Tree view shows directory structure
- **Native Integration**: Uses Qt's file system model for OS integration
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically reflects file system changes
- **Visual Organization**: Standard file/folder icons and styling

## Files Involved

- `src/gui.py` - File explorer implementation
- Integration with PySide6 file system components
- Tab organization within main window

## Dependencies

- PySide6 QTreeView and QFileSystemModel
- Qt's native file system integration
- Operating system file system APIs

## Related Issues

- [#014] UI/UX Design - File explorer integrated into overall design
- [#007] File System Tools - Backend file operations
- [#018] Application Packaging - File system access considerations
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## User Benefits

### File Management
- **Direct Access**: Browse project files without leaving the application
- **Output Monitoring**: See files created by agent operations
- **Quick Navigation**: Easy access to configuration and data files
- **Context Awareness**: View files in relation to agent activities

### Integration with Agent Workflow
- **Output Files**: Monitor files created by agent tasks
- **Configuration Access**: Quick access to constitution.yaml and other config
- **Project Overview**: See complete project structure at a glance
- **File Status**: Real-time updates when agent modifies files

## Explorer Capabilities

### Navigation Features
- **Tree Expansion**: Click to expand/collapse directories
- **Root Directory**: Shows entire project structure
- **File Details**: Standard file system information display
- **Sorting**: Native sorting by name, type, size, date

### Visual Organization
- **Standard Icons**: File type icons for easy recognition
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear parent-child relationships
- **Professional Styling**: Consistent with OS file explorer appearance

## Integration with Other Components

The file explorer works alongside:
- **Constitution Editor**: Quick access to constitution.yaml
- **Persona Editor**: Easy navigation to persona.yaml
- **Documentation Tab**: Access to documentation files
- **Task Results**: View files created by agent operations

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Files loaded on-demand for large directories
- **Native Performance**: Uses OS-optimized file system APIs
- **Efficient Updates**: Only refreshes changed portions of tree
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of file system resources

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- **File Operations**: Context menu for copy/paste/delete
- **File Preview**: Quick preview pane for text files
- **Search Functionality**: Find files within project structure
- **Bookmarks**: Quick access to frequently used directories
- **Integration**: Double-click to open files in appropriate applications

## Security Considerations

File explorer access is:
- **Read-Only**: Viewing capabilities without modification risk
- **Project Scoped**: Root set to project directory
- **Safe Navigation**: No access to sensitive system directories
- **User Controlled**: Users maintain full control over file operations
