# Task Input Components

**Issue Number**: #015  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 4 - Modern Desktop Interface  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  

## Summary

Develop the core UI components including a task input field and control buttons (Run, Stop).

## Description

Implement the primary user interaction components that allow users to input tasks and control agent execution. These components form the main interface for agent operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Task input field with clear placeholder text
- [x] Run Task button for executing agent operations
- [x] Stop Task button for canceling operations
- [x] Additional control button for testing functionality
- [x] Proper button state management (enable/disable)
- [x] Clear visual feedback for user actions
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts and accessibility support
- [x] Integration with agent workflow

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- Task input implemented as `QLineEdit` with placeholder text
- Three control buttons: Run Task, Stop Task, Run Tests
- Proper state management with button enable/disable logic
- Professional button layout and spacing
- Full integration with background agent operations
- Responsive UI updates during task execution

## Component Details

### Task Input Field
```python
self.task_input = QLineEdit()
self.task_input.setPlaceholderText("Enter your task here...")
```
- Clear placeholder guidance for users
- Single-line input appropriate for task descriptions
- Integrated with main window layout
- Accepts Enter key for task submission

### Control Buttons
```python
self.run_button = QPushButton("Run Task")
self.stop_button = QPushButton("Stop Task")
self.test_button = QPushButton("Run Tests")
```

**Button Behavior**:
- **Run Task**: Initiates agent processing of entered task
- **Stop Task**: Cancels currently running operations
- **Run Tests**: Executes test suite for system validation

## State Management

Smart button state management:
- **Run Task**: Disabled during task execution
- **Stop Task**: Enabled only during task execution
- **Run Tests**: Independent of task execution state
- Visual feedback for current system state

## User Interaction Flow

1. **Task Entry**: User enters task in input field
2. **Execution**: User clicks "Run Task" button
3. **Feedback**: UI provides immediate response
4. **Monitoring**: User can monitor progress in log viewer
5. **Control**: User can stop operation if needed
6. **Completion**: UI returns to ready state

## Files Involved

- `src/gui.py` - Main implementation of input components
- Integration with MainWindow class
- Connection to agent workflow

## Dependencies

- PySide6 widgets (QLineEdit, QPushButton)
- Threading system for background operations
- Agent components for task processing

- [#016] Real-time Log Viewer - Displays results from task input
- [#011] Main Application Loop - Backend processing for task input
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Event Handling

Robust event handling system:
- Button click events properly connected
- Task input validation
- Thread management for non-blocking operations
- Error handling and user feedback

## Accessibility Features

- Clear button labels and descriptions
- Standard keyboard navigation
- Visual state indicators
- Screen reader compatible elements
- Consistent interaction patterns

## Visual Design

Professional appearance with:
- Standard button sizing and spacing
- Consistent visual hierarchy
- Clear input field with helpful placeholder
- Logical horizontal layout for controls
- Integration with overall UI design

## Integration with Agent System

The components integrate with:
- **AgentWorker**: Background thread for task processing
- **TestWorker**: Background thread for test execution
- **MainWindow**: Overall application state management
- **Logging System**: Real-time feedback display

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid task input validation
- Execution failure feedback
- Thread management errors
- UI state recovery on errors
