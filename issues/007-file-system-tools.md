# File System Tools

**Issue Number**: #007  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 2 - Tooling  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  

## Summary

Develop tools for reading, writing, and listing files.

## Description

Implement essential file system operations that allow the agent to interact with the local file system safely and effectively. These tools form the foundation for many agent capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] File system tools module created in `src/tools/file_system.py`
- [x] `read_file(filename)` function implemented
- [x] `write_file(filename, content)` function implemented
- [x] `list_directory(path)` function implemented
- [x] `remove_directory(path)` function implemented
- [x] Proper error handling for file operations
- [x] Integration with Executor module
- [x] Unit tests for all file operations

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- `src/tools/file_system.py` exists with all required functions
- Comprehensive file operations including read, write, list, and remove
- Proper error handling for common file system issues
- Integration with main application through Executor
- Used throughout the system for configuration and data management

## Available Functions

```python
def read_file(filename):
    """Read and return the contents of a file."""

def write_file(filename, content):
    """Write content to a file."""

def list_directory(path):
    """List the contents of a directory."""

def remove_directory(path):
    """Remove a directory and its contents."""
```

## Files Involved

- `src/tools/file_system.py` - Main implementation
- `src/tools/__init__.py` - Tool module initialization
- Integration in `src/main.py` and `src/executor.py`

## Dependencies

- Python's built-in `os` and file I/O operations
- Integration with constitution.yaml for permission control

## Related Issues

- [#003] Governor Module - Controls file system access permissions
- [#004] Executor Module - Executes file system operations
- [#009] Tool Integration - Overall tool architecture
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Security Considerations

File system tools are governed by:
- Constitution permissions for allowed operations
- Governor approval required for all file operations
- Safe handling of file paths and content
- Error handling prevents system damage

## Usage Examples

The tools are used for:
- Reading configuration files (constitution.yaml)
- Managing output files and directories
- Listing project contents for user queries
- Cleaning up temporary files and build artifacts

## Testing

File system operations are thoroughly tested with:
- Mock file systems for unit tests
- Integration tests with real file operations
- Error condition testing
- Permission and security testing

**Original Task from DEV_PLAN.md**:  
"**File System Tools:** Develop tools for reading, writing, and listing files."

**Implementation Status**: Fully implemented with comprehensive file system operations. Provides secure, controlled access to file system resources with proper error handling.
