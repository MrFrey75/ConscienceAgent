# Real-time Log Viewer

**Issue Number**: #016  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 4 - Modern Desktop Interface  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  

## Summary

Implement a real-time log viewer to display the agent's internal monologue and decisions.

## Description

Create a comprehensive log viewing component that shows the agent's decision-making process in real-time, providing transparency into the Proposer-Governor-Executor workflow. This is critical for user trust and debugging.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Real-time log display with automatic updates
- [x] Rich text formatting for better readability
- [x] Color coding for different types of messages (success, warnings, errors)
- [x] Automatic scrolling to show latest messages
- [x] Read-only display to prevent user modification
- [x] Integration with agent workflow for live updates
- [x] Clear visual distinction between different workflow stages
- [x] Timestamped entries for audit purposes

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- `QTextEdit` widget configured for read-only rich text display
- Real-time updates through signal/slot mechanism
- HTML formatting support for colors and styling
- Automatic scroll-to-bottom for latest messages
- Integration with both agent tasks and test execution
- Professional formatting for different message types

## Technical Implementation

### Log Viewer Component
```python
self.log_viewer = QTextEdit()
self.log_viewer.setReadOnly(True)
```

### Message Formatting
- **Success Messages**: Green color formatting
- **Error Messages**: Red color formatting  
- **Standard Messages**: Default formatting
- **Timestamps**: Automatic inclusion for audit trail

## Real-time Update System

The log viewer receives updates through:
- **AgentWorker Signals**: Live updates during task execution
- **TestWorker Signals**: Test execution results
- **Direct Logging**: Immediate display of important messages
- **HTML Formatting**: Rich text with color coding

## Display Features

### Message Categories
- **Task Reception**: Shows received user tasks
- **Action Proposals**: Displays Proposer suggestions
- **Governor Decisions**: Shows approval/denial with reasoning
- **Execution Results**: Displays tool execution outcomes
- **Test Results**: Shows test suite execution status
- **Error Conditions**: Highlighted error messages and warnings

### Visual Organization
- Clear message separation
- Consistent formatting patterns
- Automatic line breaks for readability
- Proper text wrapping for long messages

## Files Involved

- `src/gui.py` - Main log viewer implementation
- Integration with worker threads for real-time updates
- Connection to agent workflow components

## Dependencies

- PySide6 QTextEdit widget
- HTML formatting support
- Signal/slot system for real-time updates
- Threading integration for non-blocking updates

- [#014] UI/UX Design - Log viewer is central to transparency design
- [#015] Task Input Components - Displays results from task execution
- [#011] Main Application Loop - Shows workflow execution in real-time
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Transparency Features

The log viewer provides complete visibility into:
- **Agent Reasoning**: Shows how tasks are interpreted
- **Decision Making**: Displays Governor approval logic
- **Action Execution**: Shows tool invocation and results
- **Error Handling**: Highlights issues and recovery attempts
- **Performance**: Shows execution timing and efficiency

## User Experience Benefits

- **Trust Building**: Users can see exactly what the agent is doing
- **Debugging**: Easy identification of issues and failures
- **Learning**: Users learn how to phrase tasks effectively
- **Monitoring**: Real-time awareness of agent activities
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all agent operations

## Technical Features

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient text updates without full redraws
- Proper memory management for long-running sessions
- Smooth scrolling and display updates
- Responsive UI during heavy logging

### Formatting Capabilities
- HTML support for rich text display
- Color coding for different message types
- Bold/italic text for emphasis
- Proper line spacing and organization

## Integration with Agent Workflow

The log viewer connects with:
- **Main Application**: Direct logging of key events
- **Worker Threads**: Asynchronous updates during processing
- **Error System**: Immediate display of error conditions
- **Test Framework**: Test execution results and status
