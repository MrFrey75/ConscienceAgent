# Constitution System

**Issue Number**: #005  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 1 - Core Framework  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  

## Summary

Create a `constitution.yaml` file with a basic set of rules governing agent behavior.

## Description

The constitution serves as the fundamental rulebook for the agent's behavior. It defines what actions are permitted and establishes the ethical boundaries within which the agent must operate.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `constitution.yaml` file created in project root
- [x] YAML structure defining allowed actions
- [x] Clear, readable format for rule specification
- [x] Integration with Governor module
- [x] Test constitution file for testing scenarios
- [x] Documentation of constitution structure

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- `constitution.yaml` exists with comprehensive action permissions
- Clear YAML structure with `allowed_actions` list
- Includes all necessary tools for basic agent functionality
- Test constitution (`tests/test_constitution.yaml`) for testing restricted scenarios
- Well-documented structure that's easy to modify

## Current Configuration

The constitution currently allows these actions:
```yaml
allowed_actions:
  - search_web
  - read_file
  - write_file
  - list_directory
  - open_file
  - remove_directory
```

## Files Involved

- `constitution.yaml` - Main constitution file
- `tests/test_constitution.yaml` - Test-specific restricted constitution
- Integration with `src/governor.py`

## Dependencies

- PyYAML for parsing
- Governor module for enforcement

## Related Issues

- [#003] Governor Module - Enforces the constitution
- [#029] Constitution Evolution - Future self-modification of rules
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Security Considerations

The constitution is a critical security component that:
- Prevents unauthorized file system access outside allowed operations
- Controls which external services the agent can access
- Establishes clear boundaries for agent behavior
- Provides audit trail for rule changes

## Future Enhancements

- More granular permissions (file path restrictions, etc.)
- Dynamic rule loading
- Rule precedence and inheritance
- Contextual permissions

## Modification Guidelines

When modifying the constitution:
1. Consider security implications of each new permission
2. Test thoroughly with restricted test constitution
3. Document the reasoning for rule changes
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality

**Original Task from DEV_PLAN.md**:  
"**Constitution:** Create a `constitution.yaml` file with a basic set of rules."

**Implementation Status**: Fully implemented with a comprehensive, secure rule set. Provides the foundation for safe agent operation with clear permission boundaries.
