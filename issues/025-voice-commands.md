# Voice Commands

**Issue Number**: #025  
**Status**: ❌ TODO  
**Phase**: 7 - Enhanced User Interaction  
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  

## Summary

Integrate a speech-to-text engine to allow users to interact with the agent using voice commands.

## Description

Add voice input capabilities that allow users to speak their tasks and commands directly to the agent, making interaction more natural and hands-free. This enhances accessibility and user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Speech-to-text engine selection and integration
- [ ] Voice input capture and processing
- [ ] Audio quality improvement and noise reduction
- [ ] Multi-language support consideration  
- [ ] Voice activation and control mechanisms
- [ ] Integration with existing task input systems
- [ ] Fallback to text input when voice fails
- [ ] Privacy-conscious voice processing
- [ ] Voice command testing and validation
- [ ] Accessibility features for speech input

## Current Status

**Status**: ❌ TODO (Planned Future Development)
The current system only supports text input through CLI and GUI interfaces.

## Technical Approach

### Speech-to-Text Options
1. **Cloud APIs**: Google Speech-to-Text, Azure Speech, AWS Transcribe
2. **Local Engines**: OpenAI Whisper, Mozilla DeepSpeech, SpeechRecognition
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Local processing with cloud backup
4. **Platform Native**: OS built-in speech recognition

### Recommended Approach: OpenAI Whisper
- **Advantages**: High accuracy, local processing, multi-language support
- **Privacy**: No data sent to cloud services
- **Cost**: Free after initial setup
- **Performance**: Real-time capable with appropriate hardware

## Implementation Components

### Audio Input System
- **Microphone Access**: System audio input integration
- **Voice Activity Detection**: Detect when user is speaking
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Noise reduction and quality enhancement
- **Buffer Management**: Handle continuous audio streams

### Speech Processing Pipeline
```
Audio Input → Voice Detection → Speech-to-Text → Text Processing → Task Execution
```

### Integration Points
- **GUI Integration**: Voice input button in desktop interface
- **CLI Integration**: Voice mode for command-line interface
- **Task Processing**: Seamless integration with existing task pipeline
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to text input

## Files Involved

- New voice input modules (`src/voice/`)
- Audio processing and speech-to-text integration
- Updated GUI with voice input controls
- Enhanced CLI with voice mode support
- Configuration files for voice settings

## Dependencies

- Speech-to-text library (OpenAI Whisper recommended)
- Audio processing libraries (PyAudio, sounddevice)
- GUI framework integration for voice controls
- System audio access permissions

## Related Issues

- [#022] Natural Language Understanding - Voice input benefits from NLP
- [#026] Spoken Responses - Complete voice interaction system
- [#027] Interactive Dialogue - Voice enables natural conversation
- [#015] Task Input Components - Voice as alternative input method
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## User Experience Features

### Voice Activation
- **Push-to-Talk**: Hold button to record voice command
- **Wake Word**: "Hey Agent" or similar activation phrase
- **Manual Trigger**: Click to activate voice input
- **Continuous Listening**: Optional always-on voice detection

### Feedback Systems
- **Visual Indicators**: Show when listening, processing, or complete
- **Audio Feedback**: Confirmation beeps or sounds
- **Transcription Display**: Show what was understood from speech
- **Correction Mechanism**: Allow users to correct transcription errors

## Privacy and Security

### Privacy Protection
- **Local Processing**: Keep voice data on user's device
- **No Storage**: Don't permanently store audio recordings
- **User Control**: Easy disable/enable of voice features
- **Transparency**: Clear indication when voice is being processed

### Security Considerations
- **Microphone Permissions**: Request appropriate system permissions
- **Data Handling**: Secure processing of voice data
- **Access Control**: Ensure voice commands respect Governor restrictions
- **Audit Logging**: Log voice command usage for security review

## Accessibility Benefits

### Enhanced Access
- **Hands-Free Operation**: Useful when typing is difficult
- **Motor Impairments**: Voice input for users with limited mobility
- **Multitasking**: Interact while doing other tasks
- **Natural Interaction**: More intuitive for some users

### Inclusive Design
- **Language Support**: Multiple language recognition
- **Accent Tolerance**: Robust recognition across accents
- **Speed Adaptation**: Handle different speaking speeds
- **Clarity Assistance**: Work with unclear speech patterns

## Technical Challenges

### Audio Processing
- **Noise Handling**: Filter out background noise and interference
- **Multiple Speakers**: Handle environments with multiple voices
- **Audio Quality**: Work with various microphone qualities
- **Real-Time Processing**: Minimize latency for responsive experience

### Integration Complexity
- **GUI Threading**: Non-blocking audio processing in UI
- **State Management**: Coordinate voice input with other input methods
- **Error Recovery**: Handle speech recognition failures gracefully
- **Platform Differences**: Cross-platform audio system differences

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Voice Profiles**: Learn individual user speech patterns
- **Context Awareness**: Use conversation context to improve recognition
- **Command Shortcuts**: Voice macros for common tasks
- **Voice Authentication**: Use voice patterns for user identification

### Integration Improvements
- **Smart Home Integration**: Voice control through smart speakers
- **Mobile Support**: Voice input on mobile devices
- **Remote Access**: Voice commands over network connections
- **Multi-Modal**: Combine voice with gesture or visual inputs
