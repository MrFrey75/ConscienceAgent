# Executor Module

**Issue Number**: #004  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 1 - Core Framework  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  

## Summary

Develop the `Executor` class to perform actions approved by the Governor.

## Description

The Executor is the "doing" component of the agent. It takes approved actions and executes them using the appropriate tools. It serves as the interface between the agent's decision-making and the actual tool implementations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Executor class created in `src/executor.py`
- [x] `execute_action(action)` method implemented
- [x] Tool registry system for managing available actions
- [x] Proper argument handling for tool execution
- [x] Error handling for unknown/missing tools
- [x] Integration with all available tools
- [x] Unit tests for the Executor class

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- `src/executor.py` exists with Executor class
- Constructor accepts tools dictionary for flexible tool registration
- `execute_action()` method looks up tools by action name
- Robust argument passing with proper error handling
- Returns results from tool execution
- Handles unknown actions gracefully with error messages
- Comprehensive test coverage in `tests/test_executor.py` with mocked tools

## Technical Details

```python
class Executor:
    def __init__(self, tools):
        self.tools = tools

    def execute_action(self, action):
        tool = self.tools.get(action["action"])
        if tool:
            args = action.get("args", [])
            return tool(*args)
        else:
            return f"Unknown action: {action['action']}"
```

## Tool Integration

Currently integrated tools:
- File system operations (read_file, write_file, list_directory, remove_directory)
- Web search functionality
- System operations (open_file)

## Files Involved

- `src/executor.py` - Main implementation
- `tests/test_executor.py` - Unit tests with mocked tools
- `src/main.py` - Tool registry and integration

## Dependencies

- Tool implementations in `src/tools/` directory
- Actions must be approved by Governor before execution

## Related Issues

- [#002] Proposer Module - Generates actions to execute
- [#003] Governor Module - Approves actions before execution
- [#007] File System Tools - Provides file operations
- [#008] Web Search Tool - Provides web search capability
- [#009] Tool Integration - Overall tool system architecture
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Error Handling

The Executor includes proper error handling for:
- Unknown action types
- Missing or invalid arguments
- Tool execution failures
- Missing tool implementations

**Original Task from DEV_PLAN.md**:  
"**Executor Module:** Develop the `Executor` class to perform actions approved by the Governor."

**Implementation Status**: Fully implemented with comprehensive tool integration system. Serves as the reliable execution engine for all agent actions.
