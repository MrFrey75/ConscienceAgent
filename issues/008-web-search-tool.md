# Web Search Tool

**Issue Number**: #008  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 2 - Tooling  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  

## Summary

Implement a tool for searching the web to enable information gathering capabilities.

## Description

Develop web search functionality that allows the agent to search for information online. This capability is essential for research tasks and answering questions that require external information.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Web search tool created in `src/tools/web_search.py`
- [x] `search_web(query)` function implemented
- [x] Integration with search service/API
- [x] Proper error handling for network issues
- [x] Integration with Executor module
- [x] Constitution controls for web access
- [x] Unit tests for web search functionality

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- `src/tools/web_search.py` exists with `search_web()` function
- Integrated with main application through Executor
- Controlled by constitution permissions for security
- Used by Proposer for knowledge-based queries
- Proper error handling for network and API issues

## Technical Implementation

```python
def search_web(query):
    """Search the web for information based on the given query."""
    # Implementation details would include:
    # - API integration
    # - Result formatting
    # - Error handling
    # - Rate limiting
```

## Files Involved

- `src/tools/web_search.py` - Main implementation
- `src/tools/__init__.py` - Tool module initialization
- Integration in `src/main.py` and `src/executor.py`

## Dependencies

- Web search API or service
- Network connectivity
- Constitution permission: `search_web`

## Related Issues

- [#003] Governor Module - Controls web access permissions
- [#004] Executor Module - Executes web search operations
- [#009] Tool Integration - Overall tool architecture
- [#022] Natural Language Understanding - Future enhanced search capabilities
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Security Considerations

Web search is carefully controlled through:
- Constitution permissions requiring explicit `search_web` approval
- Governor oversight of all search operations
- Safe handling of search queries and results
- Network error handling to prevent system issues

## Usage Examples

The web search tool is used for:
- Research queries (e.g., "history of artificial intelligence")
- Information gathering for complex questions
- Fact-checking and verification
- Current events and news queries

## API Integration

The implementation may integrate with:
- Search engine APIs (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
- Specialized research databases
- Academic search services
- News aggregation services

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
- Multiple search engine support
- Result ranking and filtering
- Source credibility assessment
- Caching for repeated queries
- Advanced query parsing and optimization
