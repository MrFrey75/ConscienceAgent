# GUI Framework Selection

**Issue Number**: #013  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 4 - Modern Desktop Interface  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  

## Summary

Research and select a suitable cross-platform GUI framework for the desktop application.

## Description

Evaluate and choose a GUI framework that provides cross-platform compatibility, modern UI capabilities, and good Python integration for building the desktop interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] GUI framework research and evaluation completed
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility confirmed (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [x] Framework selected and integrated into project
- [x] Dependencies added to requirements.txt
- [x] Basic framework setup and testing completed
- [x] Framework supports required UI components

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Selected Framework**: PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- Added to requirements.txt: `PySide6==6.9.1`
- Full cross-platform support confirmed
- Comprehensive widget set available
- Professional-looking modern UI capabilities
- Active development and good documentation

## Framework Evaluation

### PySide6 (Selected)
✅ **Advantages**:
- Official Qt bindings for Python
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Modern, native-looking UI components
- Rich widget set including trees, tabs, text editors
- Threading support for background operations
- Professional appearance and performance
- Extensive documentation and community

### Alternative Frameworks Considered:
- **PyQt**: Similar to PySide6 but with licensing concerns
- **Kivy**: Good for mobile but less native desktop feel
- **Tkinter**: Built-in but limited modern UI capabilities
- **Electron + Python**: Overhead and complexity concerns

## Technical Requirements Met

PySide6 provides all required capabilities:
- Task input fields and control buttons ✅
- Real-time log viewer with rich text ✅
- File explorer with tree view ✅
- Built-in text editor for constitution ✅
- Tabbed interface for organization ✅
- Threading for background tasks ✅

## Files Involved

- `requirements.txt` - PySide6 dependency
- `src/gui.py` - Main GUI implementation using PySide6

## Dependencies

- PySide6==6.9.1 - Main GUI framework
- Python 3.x compatibility

## Related Issues

- [#015] Task Input Components - Built using PySide6 widgets
- [#016] Real-time Log Viewer - QTextEdit implementation
- [#017] File Explorer Component - QTreeView implementation
- [#018] Application Packaging - Framework packaging considerations
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Integration Benefits

PySide6 integration provides:
- Native look and feel on all platforms
- High-quality rendering and performance
- Professional UI components out of the box
- Easy threading for responsive UI
- Comprehensive event handling system
- Rich text formatting capabilities

## Installation and Setup

```bash
pip install PySide6==6.9.1
```

The framework is properly integrated and ready for development.
