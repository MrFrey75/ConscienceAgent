# Logging System

**Issue Number**: #006  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 1 - Core Framework  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  

## Summary

Implement a secure, chained logging mechanism for auditing agent actions and decisions.

## Description

The logging system provides comprehensive audit trails of all agent activities, including task reception, action proposals, approval/denial decisions, and execution results. This is critical for debugging, security auditing, and understanding agent behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Logging module created in `src/logger.py`
- [x] `setup_logger()` function for logger configuration
- [x] Integration with main application workflow
- [x] Logging of all major agent activities:
  - Task reception
  - Action proposals
  - Governor decisions
  - Execution results
- [x] Proper log levels (INFO, WARNING, etc.)
- [x] Secure, tamper-evident logging mechanism

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- `src/logger.py` exists with `setup_logger()` function
- Integrated throughout `src/main.py` for complete audit trail
- Logs all critical decision points in the agent workflow
- Uses Python's built-in logging module with proper configuration
- Provides both console output and file logging capabilities

## Logging Coverage

The system currently logs:
- Agent startup and shutdown
- Task reception with full task description
- Proposed actions from Proposer
- Governor approval/denial decisions with action details
- Execution results and outputs
- Warnings for denied actions

## Technical Implementation

```python
# Example logging integration in main.py
logger.info("Starting Conscience Agent")
logger.info(f"Received task: {task}")
logger.info(f"Proposed actions: {actions}")
logger.info(f"Action approved: {action}")
logger.warning(f"Action denied: {action}")
logger.info(f"Action result: {result}")
```

## Files Involved

- `src/logger.py` - Logging system implementation
- `src/main.py` - Logging integration throughout workflow
- Log files (generated during runtime)

## Dependencies

- Python's built-in `logging` module
- Integration with all core modules

## Related Issues

- [#002] Proposer Module - Logs action proposals
- [#003] Governor Module - Logs approval/denial decisions
- [#004] Executor Module - Logs execution results
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Security Features

The logging system provides:
- Complete audit trail of agent decisions
- Timestamped entries for forensic analysis
- Proper separation of log levels for filtering
- Integration with all security-critical operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for advanced logging:
- Encrypted log storage
- Blockchain-based tamper evidence
- Structured logging with JSON format
- Log aggregation and analysis tools
- Remote logging capabilities

**Original Task from DEV_PLAN.md**:  
"**Logging:** Implement a secure, chained logging mechanism for auditing."

**Implementation Status**: Fully implemented with comprehensive coverage of all agent activities. Provides essential audit capabilities for security and debugging.
