# Self-Correction and Learning

**Issue Number**: #024  
**Status**: ❌ TODO  
**Phase**: 6 - Advanced Intelligence  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Large  

## Summary

Develop a mechanism for the agent to learn from its mistakes. If an action fails or produces an unexpected result, the agent should be able to analyze the outcome and propose a different course of action.

## Description

Implement an intelligent feedback and learning system that allows the agent to analyze action outcomes, detect failures or suboptimal results, and adapt its behavior for future similar situations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Result analysis and outcome evaluation system
- [ ] Failure detection and classification mechanisms
- [ ] Learning algorithms for pattern recognition
- [ ] Alternative strategy generation capabilities
- [ ] Performance metrics and success measurement
- [ ] Adaptive behavior modification
- [ ] Knowledge base for learned patterns
- [ ] Self-correction workflow integration
- [ ] Learning persistence across sessions
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of learning behaviors

## Current Status

**Status**: ❌ TODO (Planned Future Development)
The current agent executes actions without learning from outcomes or adapting behavior based on results.
