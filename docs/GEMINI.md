# Using the Conscience Agent for Development

Welcome, developer. This guide provides a tailored overview for using the Conscience Agent's core logic.

### The Core Concept: Safe, Auditable AI

The Conscience Agent is an experimental AI framework designed for safety and transparency. It works by separating the process of thinking from the act of doing. For a non-technical overview, please see [`SIMPLE_EXPLANATION.md`](./SIMPLE_EXPLANATION.md).

This structure ensures that no accidental or harmful actions can be taken, making the agent trustworthy and controllable. Every decision is logged and justified, giving you a clear audit trail.

### The Development Workflow: From Broad Question to Focused Answer

Your primary role is to act as the lead researcher, guiding the agent's focus. The most effective way to work with the agent is through an iterative cycle of inquiry.

1.  **Phase 1: Exploration:** Start with a broad, high-level task to get an overview of your topic.
2.  **Phase 2: Deep Dive:** Use the insights from the exploration phase to ask more specific, targeted questions.
3.  **Phase 3: Synthesis:** Once you have gathered sufficient detailed information, instruct the agent to consolidate its findings into a cohesive report.

This methodical process allows you to leverage the agent's tools to build a comprehensive understanding of a topic or codebase.

### Ethical and Community Guidelines

The agent's design is rooted in a deontological (rule-based) ethical framework. The responsibility for the agent's actions ultimately rests with you, the operator. For a deeper understanding of the philosophical principles, please refer to [`ETHICS.md`](./ETHICS.md).

This is an open-source experiment. If you wish to contribute, please see the guidelines in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
