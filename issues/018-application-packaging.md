# Application Packaging

**Issue Number**: #018  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNING  
**Phase**: 4 - Modern Desktop Interface  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Medium  

## Summary

Create distributable application bundles for major operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) using a tool like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.

## Description

Develop a packaging and distribution system that creates standalone executables for the Conscience Agent desktop application, allowing users to run the application without requiring Python or dependency installation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Packaging tool selected and configured (PyInstaller recommended)
- [ ] Build scripts for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] Standalone executables created for each platform
- [ ] All dependencies bundled correctly (PySide6, PyYAML)
- [ ] Application icons and metadata configured
- [ ] Installation packages created (MSI, DMG, DEB/RPM)
- [ ] Cross-platform build and testing pipeline
- [ ] Distribution documentation and release process

## Current Status

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNING
This feature is planned but not yet implemented. The GUI application exists and functions properly in development, but packaging for distribution has not been completed.

## Recommended Approach

### Tool Selection: PyInstaller
PyInstaller is recommended for this project because:
- Excellent PySide6/PyQt support
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Good handling of complex dependencies
- Active community and documentation
- Proven track record with GUI applications

### Build Configuration

```bash
# Example PyInstaller command
pyinstaller --windowed --onefile --name "ConscienceAgent" \
    --icon=assets/icon.ico \
    --add-data "constitution.yaml:." \
    --add-data "persona.yaml:." \
    src/gui.py
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Packaging
1. **Tool Setup**: Install and configure PyInstaller
2. **Spec File**: Create PyInstaller specification file
3. **Basic Build**: Generate basic executable
4. **Dependency Testing**: Verify all dependencies are included

### Phase 2: Platform-Specific Builds
1. **Windows**: Create Windows executable (.exe)
2. **macOS**: Create macOS application bundle (.app)
3. **Linux**: Create Linux executable
4. **Testing**: Test on each platform

### Phase 3: Installers and Distribution
1. **Windows**: MSI installer creation
2. **macOS**: DMG disk image creation
3. **Linux**: DEB/RPM package creation
4. **Documentation**: User installation guides

## Files Involved

- Build scripts and configuration files (to be created)
- `requirements.txt` - Dependency specification
- Application assets (icons, resources)
- Distribution documentation

## Dependencies

### Build Dependencies
- PyInstaller or cx_Freeze
- Platform-specific build tools
- Code signing certificates (for distribution)

### Runtime Dependencies (to be bundled)
- PySide6==6.9.1
- PyYAML==6.0.1
- Python runtime
- System libraries

## Related Issues

- [#013] GUI Framework Selection - PySide6 packaging considerations
- [#014] UI/UX Design - Application icons and branding
- All GUI components need to work in packaged environment
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Packaging Challenges

### Known Considerations
- **Large Bundle Size**: GUI frameworks create large distributions
- **Platform Testing**: Need access to Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Code Signing**: Required for distribution without security warnings
- **Update Mechanism**: Consider auto-update capabilities
- **Asset Handling**: Ensure all resources are properly bundled

## Distribution Strategy

### Release Channels
- **GitHub Releases**: Primary distribution method
- **Direct Download**: From project website
- **Package Managers**: Future consideration (brew, chocolatey, snap)

### Version Management
- Semantic versioning (SemVer)
- Release notes and changelog
- Backward compatibility considerations

## Testing Requirements

### Pre-release Testing
- Fresh OS installations
- Various OS versions
- Antivirus compatibility
- User acceptance testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Auto-updater**: Automatic application updates
- **Crash Reporting**: Telemetry and error reporting
- **Telemetry**: Usage analytics (privacy-conscious)
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture
- **Multiple Languages**: Internationalization support

**Original Task from DEV_PLAN.md**:  
"**Application Packaging:** Create distributable application bundles for major operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) using a tool like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze."

**Implementation Status**: Planning phase. The GUI application is fully functional in development environment, but packaging for distribution requires implementation of build and packaging pipeline.
