# Tool Integration

**Issue Number**: #009  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 2 - Tooling  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  

## Summary

Integrate the tools with the Executor and establish the overall tool architecture.

## Description

Create a cohesive tool integration system that allows the Executor to manage and invoke various tools in a consistent manner. This establishes the plugin-like architecture for extending agent capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Tool registry system implemented in Executor
- [x] Consistent tool interface and calling convention
- [x] Dynamic tool loading and registration
- [x] Integration of all available tools:
  - File System Tools
  - Web Search Tool
  - System Tools
- [x] Proper error handling for missing tools
- [x] Tool discovery and management system

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- Tool integration implemented in `src/main.py` with tools dictionary
- Executor class accepts tools registry in constructor
- Consistent tool calling interface through action dictionaries
- All tools properly registered and accessible
- System tools added for additional functionality (open_file)

## Tool Architecture

```python
# Tool registry in main.py
tools = {
    "read_file": read_file,
    "write_file": write_file,
    "list_directory": list_directory,
    "search_web": search_web,
    "open_file": open_file,
    "remove_directory": remove_directory,
}
executor = Executor(tools)
```

## Integrated Tools

Currently integrated tools:
- **File System Tools**: read_file, write_file, list_directory, remove_directory
- **Web Search Tool**: search_web
- **System Tools**: open_file

## Files Involved

- `src/main.py` - Tool registry and integration
- `src/executor.py` - Tool execution system
- `src/tools/` - Individual tool implementations
  - `file_system.py`
  - `web_search.py`
  - `system.py`

## Dependencies

- All tool implementations
- Executor module
- Constitution permissions for each tool

## Related Issues

- [#004] Executor Module - Executes integrated tools
- [#007] File System Tools - Provides file operations
- [#008] Web Search Tool - Provides search capability
- [#003] Governor Module - Controls tool access through constitution
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Tool Interface Standard

All tools follow a consistent interface:
- Function-based implementation
- Standardized argument passing
- Consistent return value format
- Proper error handling and reporting

## Extensibility

The tool integration system supports:
- Easy addition of new tools
- Dynamic tool registration
- Modular tool development
- Clear separation of concerns

## Testing

Tool integration is tested through:
- Unit tests for individual tools
- Integration tests for tool execution
- Mock tool testing for error conditions
- End-to-end workflow testing

## Future Enhancements

The architecture supports future additions:
- Plugin-based tool loading
- Tool dependencies and prerequisites
- Tool versioning and compatibility
- Dynamic tool discovery
- Tool marketplace or registry

**Original Task from DEV_PLAN.md**:  
"**Tool Integration:** Integrate the tools with the Executor."

**Implementation Status**: Fully implemented with a clean, extensible architecture. All tools are properly integrated and accessible through the Executor system.
