# Stateful Task Management

**Issue Number**: #023  
**Status**: ❌ TODO  
**Phase**: 6 - Advanced Intelligence  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Large  

## Summary

Implement a memory system that allows the agent to track the state of a task over multiple steps. This will enable the agent to reason about the results of previous actions and plan accordingly.

## Description

Create a sophisticated memory and state management system that allows the agent to maintain context across multiple interactions, remember previous actions and their results, and plan multi-step workflows intelligently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design persistent state storage system
- [ ] Implement task context and memory management
- [ ] Create multi-step task planning capabilities
- [ ] Add result analysis and learning mechanisms
- [ ] Implement state persistence across sessions
- [ ] Create context-aware action planning
- [ ] Add task progress tracking and resumption
- [ ] Implement dependency management between actions
- [ ] Create memory cleanup and management policies
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of stateful operations

## Current Status

**Status**: ❌ TODO (Planned Future Development)
The current agent processes each task independently without memory of previous actions or ability to maintain state across multiple interactions.

## Technical Approach

### State Management Architecture
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                State Manager                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌──────────┐ │
│  │   Memory    │  │    Task     │  │ Context  │ │
│  │   Store     │  │   History   │  │  Cache   │ │
│  └─────────────┘  └─────────────┘  └──────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Storage Options
- **Local Database**: SQLite for persistent state storage
- **File-based**: JSON/YAML files for simple state persistence
- **Memory-based**: In-memory state for session-based tasks
- **Hybrid**: Combination approach for different data types

## Implementation Components

### Task State Management
- **Task Context**: Current task state and progress
- **Action History**: Record of all previous actions and results
- **Goal Tracking**: Multi-step goal decomposition and progress
- **Dependency Management**: Understanding action dependencies

### Memory System
- **Short-term Memory**: Current session context and working memory
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent knowledge and learned patterns
- **Episodic Memory**: Specific task instances and their outcomes
- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge and patterns

### Planning Capabilities
- **Multi-step Planning**: Break complex goals into actionable steps
- **Adaptive Planning**: Modify plans based on intermediate results
- **Recovery Planning**: Handle failures and unexpected outcomes
- **Optimization**: Learn from previous similar tasks

## Files Involved

- New state management modules (`src/state/`)
- Database schema or file format definitions
- Updated core modules for state integration
- Configuration files for memory management
- Enhanced tests for stateful operations

## Dependencies

- Database system (SQLite) or file system for persistence
- Updated Proposer for context-aware planning
- Enhanced Governor for stateful permission management
- Modified Executor for state tracking

## Related Issues

- [#022] Natural Language Understanding - NLP benefits from context
- [#024] Self-Correction and Learning - Learning requires memory
- [#002] Proposer Module - Needs enhancement for stateful planning
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-Step Task Execution
```
Example: "Research and write a report on AI ethics"
1. Search for AI ethics information
2. Collect and organize sources
3. Analyze key themes and issues  
4. Draft report structure
5. Write report sections
6. Review and finalize report
```

### Context Awareness
- Remember previous conversations and decisions
- Understand references to earlier actions ("continue where we left off")
- Maintain working context across tool invocations
- Track goals and sub-goals throughout complex workflows

### Adaptive Behavior
- Learn from successful task patterns
- Adjust strategies based on previous outcomes
- Recognize similar tasks and apply learned approaches
- Optimize workflows based on historical performance

## Design Considerations

### Performance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Manage memory usage for long-running sessions
- **Query Performance**: Fast access to relevant historical context
- **Cleanup Policies**: Manage storage growth over time
- **Indexing**: Efficient search through historical data

### Privacy and Security
- **Data Retention**: Policies for how long to keep task history
- **Sensitive Information**: Handling of confidential data in memory
- **Access Control**: Ensure memory system respects constitution
- **Data Protection**: Encryption and secure storage considerations

## Benefits

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Continuity**: Pick up where previous sessions ended
- **Context Understanding**: No need to re-explain previous work
- **Progressive Refinement**: Iterative improvement of complex tasks
- **Intelligent Automation**: Agent learns user preferences and patterns

### Improved Capabilities
- **Complex Workflows**: Handle sophisticated multi-step processes
- **Learning**: Improve performance through experience
- **Reliability**: Better error recovery through state awareness
- **Efficiency**: Avoid redundant work through memory

## Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **State Consistency**: Ensuring state remains accurate across actions
- **Concurrency**: Managing state in multi-threaded environments
- **Migration**: Handling schema changes in persistent state
- **Performance**: Maintaining responsiveness with large state stores

### Design Challenges
- **Privacy**: Balancing functionality with privacy concerns
- **Complexity**: Managing increased system complexity
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting stateful behaviors
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of stateful interactions

**Original Task from DEV_PLAN.md**:  
"**Stateful Task Management:** Implement a memory system that allows the agent to track the state of a task over multiple steps. This will enable the agent to reason about the results of previous actions and plan accordingly."

**Implementation Status**: Planned future development. Would transform the agent from a stateless tool to an intelligent assistant capable of complex, multi-session workflows.
