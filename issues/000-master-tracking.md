## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All core functionality is implemented and tested
- [ ] Desktop GUI is fully functional
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Complete documentation for users and developers
- [ ] Advanced AI features are implemented with appropriate safeguards
- [ ] Voice interaction capabilities are working
- [ ] Self-modification features have robust ethical controls

## Dependencies

This epic has dependencies on:
- Python 3.x environment
- PySide6 for GUI components
- PyYAML for configuration
- Web search APIs
- Speech recognition/synthesis libraries (future phases)
- NLP models (future phases)

## Related Files

- `DEV_PLAN.md` - Original development plan
- `src/` - Implementation code
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `constitution.yaml` - Agent behavior rules
- Documentation files (*.md)

## Notes

The first 5 phases represent the foundational capabilities and are largely complete. Phases 6-8 represent advanced AI capabilities that require careful ethical consideration and implementation.
