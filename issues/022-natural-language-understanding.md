# Natural Language Understanding

**Issue Number**: #022  
**Status**: ❌ TODO  
**Phase**: 6 - Advanced Intelligence  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: Large  

## Summary

Replace the current keyword-based `Proposer` with a true natural language processing (NLP) model. This will allow the agent to understand and execute complex, nuanced tasks.

## Description

Upgrade the Proposer module to use advanced NLP techniques that can understand natural language instructions, context, and intent. This represents a significant advancement from the current keyword-matching approach.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Research and select appropriate NLP model (OpenAI GPT, local model, etc.)
- [ ] Design NLP integration architecture
- [ ] Implement natural language task parsing
- [ ] Create intent recognition and classification system
- [ ] Add context understanding and maintenance
- [ ] Implement ambiguity resolution mechanisms
- [ ] Add confidence scoring for proposed actions
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms for unclear instructions
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with natural language inputs
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time operation

## Current Status

**Status**: ❌ TODO (Planned Future Development)
This feature represents advanced AI capabilities that would significantly enhance the agent's usability and intelligence. Currently, the Proposer uses simple keyword matching.

## Technical Approach

### NLP Integration Options
1. **Cloud-based APIs**: OpenAI GPT, Google Cloud NLP, AWS Comprehend
2. **Local Models**: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, NLTK
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Local processing with cloud backup
4. **Custom Training**: Domain-specific model training

### Architecture Considerations
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Maintain existing interface while upgrading internals
- **Performance**: Real-time response requirements
- **Privacy**: Consider local vs. cloud processing implications  
- **Cost**: API costs vs. computational requirements
- **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms for service outages

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Research and Design

- Architecture design and planning
- Privacy and security considerations
- Performance requirements analysis

### Phase 2: Core NLP Integration  
- Basic natural language parsing
- Intent classification system
- Action generation from natural language
- Simple context handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Complex multi-step task understanding
- Context maintenance across sessions
- Ambiguity resolution with user clarification
- Confidence scoring and validation

### Phase 4: Optimization and Polish
- Performance optimization
- Error handling and recovery
- User experience improvements
- Comprehensive testing and validation

## Files Involved

- `src/proposer.py` - Major refactoring required
- New NLP integration modules
- Configuration files for model settings
- Updated tests for NLP functionality

## Dependencies

- Selected NLP framework/API
- Additional Python packages for NLP
- Possible model files or API keys
- Updated constitution for NLP-specific permissions

## Ethical Considerations

### AI Safety
- Ensure NLP doesn't bypass Governor controls
- Validate that actions align with user intent
- Prevent manipulation or misinterpretation
- Maintain transparency in decision-making

### Privacy
- Consider data privacy implications of NLP processing
- Local vs. cloud processing decisions
- User data handling and retention policies
- Compliance with privacy regulations

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Natural Interaction**: Users can speak/type naturally
- **Reduced Learning Curve**: No need to learn specific command syntax
- **Complex Tasks**: Handle multi-step, complex instructions
- **Context Awareness**: Remember previous conversations and context

### System Capabilities
- **Intent Understanding**: Accurately parse user intentions
- **Ambiguity Handling**: Ask for clarification when needed
- **Task Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into actionable steps
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improve understanding over time

## Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Model Size**: Large NLP models require significant resources
- **Latency**: Real-time response requirements
- **Accuracy**: Ensuring correct interpretation of instructions
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing architecture

### Design Challenges
- **User Trust**: Maintaining transparency with AI-powered understanding
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of misunderstandings
- **Scope Control**: Preventing over-interpretation of instructions
- **Consistency**: Predictable behavior across different phrasings
