## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All core functionality is implemented and tested
- [x] Desktop GUI is mostly functional (packaging pending)
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage (14/14 tests passing)
- [x] Complete documentation for users and developers
- [ ] Advanced AI features are implemented with appropriate safeguards
- [ ] Voice interaction capabilities are working
- [ ] Self-modification features have robust ethical controls

## Dependencies

This epic has dependencies on:
- Python 3.x environment
- PySide6 for GUI components
- PyYAML for configuration
- Web search APIs
- Speech recognition/synthesis libraries (future phases)
- NLP models (future phases)

## Related Files

- `DEV_PLAN.md` - Original development plan
- `src/` - Implementation code
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `constitution.yaml` - Agent behavior rules
- Documentation files (*.md)

## Notes

The first 5 phases represent the foundational capabilities and are largely complete. Phases 6-8 represent advanced AI capabilities that require careful ethical consideration and implementation.
