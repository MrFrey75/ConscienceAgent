# Development Plan

This document outlines the steps to build the Conscience Agent application.

## Phase 1: Core Framework

1.  **Project Setup:** Initialize a Python project with a virtual environment.
2.  **Proposer Module:** Create the `Proposer` class that suggests actions based on a given task.
3.  **Governor Module:** Implement the `Governor` class to approve or deny actions based on the `constitution.yaml` file.
4.  **Executor Module:** Develop the `Executor` class to perform actions approved by the Governor.
5.  **Constitution:** Create a `constitution.yaml` file with a basic set of rules.
6.  **Logging:** Implement a secure, chained logging mechanism for auditing.

## Phase 2: Tooling

1.  **File System Tools:** Develop tools for reading, writing, and listing files.
2.  **Web Search Tool:** Implement a tool for searching the web.
3.  **Tool Integration:** Integrate the tools with the Executor.

## Phase 3: CLI Interface

1.  **Argument Parsing:** Use `argparse` to handle command-line arguments.
2.  **Main Loop:** Create the main application loop to process tasks.
3.  **User Interaction:** Implement user prompts and feedback.

Phase 4: Modern desktop interface

1. GUI Framework Selection: Research and select a suitable cross-platform GUI framework (e.g., PyQt, PySide, Kivy) for the desktop application. 
2. UI/UX Design: Create mockups and wireframes for the user interface, focusing on displaying the agent's thought process (Proposer, Governor, Executor steps) in a clear and intuitive way. 
3. Component Implementation: Develop the core UI components:A task input field and control buttons (Run, Stop)
A real-time log viewer to display the agent's internal monologue and decisions.
A file explorer to view and manage files in the output directory.
A built-in editor for viewing and modifying the constitution.yaml file.
5. Backend Integration: Connect the GUI components to the core agent logic, allowing the interface to send tasks and display results and logs from the agent. 
6. Application Packaging: Create distributable application bundles for major operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) using a tool like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.

## Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

1.  **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all modules and tools.
2.  **Integration Tests:** Create integration tests for the end-to-end workflow.
3.  **Documentation:** Update and expand the documentation.
