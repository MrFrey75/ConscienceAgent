# User Interaction

**Issue Number**: #012  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Phase**: 3 - CLI Interface  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: Small  

## Summary

Implement user prompts and feedback for the CLI interface.

## Description

Provide clear, informative output to users about the agent's activities, decisions, and results. This ensures users understand what the agent is doing and can monitor its behavior effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Clear output messages for all major agent activities
- [x] Task confirmation and acknowledgment
- [x] Real-time progress updates during processing
- [x] Action proposal display
- [x] Approval/denial notifications
- [x] Execution results and feedback
- [x] Error messages and user guidance
- [x] Professional, readable output formatting

## Implementation Notes

**Current Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- `src/main.py` includes comprehensive user feedback throughout the workflow
- Clear, descriptive messages for each stage of processing
- Both console output and log file recording
- Professional formatting and language
- Informative error messages

## User Feedback Features

The CLI provides feedback for:
- **Task Reception**: Confirms the task received from user
- **Action Proposals**: Shows what the agent plans to do
- **Governor Decisions**: Indicates which actions are approved/denied
- **Execution Results**: Displays the outcomes of performed actions
- **Completion Status**: Confirms when the agent finishes

## Example Output Flow

```
Received task: list files
Proposed actions: [{'action': 'list_directory', 'args': ['.']}]
Action approved: {'action': 'list_directory', 'args': ['.']}
Action result: [list of files and directories]
Conscience Agent finished task.
```

## Output Categories

### Informational Messages
- Task acknowledgment
- Progress updates
- Success confirmations
- Completion notifications

### Action Transparency
- Proposed actions display
- Governor approval/denial decisions
- Execution results
- Step-by-step process visibility

### Error Handling
- Clear error descriptions
- Guidance for resolution
- Graceful failure messages
- Recovery suggestions

## Files Involved

- `src/main.py` - Primary user interaction implementation
- Integration with logging system for dual output

## Dependencies

- Logging system for message formatting
- All agent components for status information

## Related Issues

- [#006] Logging System - Coordinates with user output
- [#010] Argument Parsing - Receives user input
- [#011] Main Application Loop - Provides processing updates
- [#000] Master tracking issue

## Design Principles

User interaction follows these principles:
- **Transparency**: Users see what the agent is thinking and doing
- **Clarity**: Messages are clear and non-technical when possible
- **Timeliness**: Feedback is provided in real-time as actions occur
- **Consistency**: Similar actions produce similar message formats
- **Helpfulness**: Error messages guide users toward solutions

## Accessibility

The output is designed to be:
- Screen reader friendly (plain text)
- Color-independent (no color coding required)
- Consistent formatting for easy parsing
- Clear language appropriate for non-technical users

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
- Verbose/quiet modes for different detail levels
- Colored output for better visual organization
- Progress bars for long-running operations
- Interactive prompts for ambiguous tasks
- Output formatting options (JSON, etc.)
